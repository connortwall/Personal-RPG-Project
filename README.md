# Personal-RPG-Project
I solo developed a 3rd-person souls-like combat, stylized, action RPG game in Unity and Unity Version Control using Unity asset store assets.
Primary features include:
- Modular weapon combat (staggering, stat-based blocking, stamina-based parries)
- Responsive item inventory
- Enemies
- Player + Enemy stats
- Consumables
- UI
- Enemy Combat + Detection AI
- Level event triggers
- (and more)...
